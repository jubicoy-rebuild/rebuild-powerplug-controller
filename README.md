# RE:BUILD

## Controller for Remote Controlled Powerplug

There is another group that works with setting up remote controller powerplugs using C.H.I.P. This group will develope an API for their system.
Prepare software for the platform of your choice (such as web or Android) for controlling these powerplugs. Implement API calls as you get the documentation from another 
group. Add cool features such as timing and creating profiles.
Work closely with this another group that prepares the C.H.I.P and powerplugs and creates the API!

Focus on:
- Good documentation for users who want to use the software
- Choosing well suiting technologies and keeping the system secure
